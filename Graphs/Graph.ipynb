    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- A **graph** is a non-linear data structure with **vertices** (nodes) and **edges** (lines or arcs).\n",
    "- **Vertices**: Fundamental units, can be labeled or unlabeled.\n",
    "- **Edges**: Connect two nodes, can be directed or undirected, and labeled or unlabeled.\n",
    "- Denoted as \\( G(V, E) \\) where \\( V \\) is the set of vertices and \\( E \\) is the set of edges.\n"

    "**Components:**\n",
    "1. **Vertices (Nodes)**: Individual entities in the graph.\n",
    "2. **Edges (Arcs)**: Connections between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Operations:**\n",
    "1. **Insertion**: Add nodes or edges.\n",
    "2. **Deletion**: Remove nodes or edges.\n",
    "3. **Searching**: Locate entities in the graph.\n",
    "4. **Traversal**: Visit all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Operations:**\n",
    "1. **Shortest Paths**: Find shortest paths between nodes.\n",
    "2. **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Find minimum weight edges to connect all nodes in a weighted, undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: Nodes represent users, edges represent connections (friends, followers).\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**: Nodes are neurons, edges are synapses.\n",
    "- **Compilers**: Used for type inference, data flow analysis, etc.\n",
    "- **Robot Planning**: Nodes represent states, edges represent transitions.\n",
    "- **GPS Navigation**: Find shortest routes and locations.\n",
    "- **Network Design**: Optimize connections in networks (e.g., minimizing wire length).\n",
    "- **Sports Analytics**: Represent player interactions and team dynamics.\n",
    "- **Computer Networks**: Represent connections between routers and switches.\n",
    "- **Transportation**: Represent connections between locations (e.g., roads, airports).\n",
    "- **Project Management**: Represent task dependencies (topological sorting)."
